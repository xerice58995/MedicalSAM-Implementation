# MedSAM Polyp Segmentation

This project implements an automated endoscopic polyp segmentation system based on **MedSAM (Segment Anything Model for Medical Images)**. By freezing the pre-trained Image Encoder and fine-tuning the Mask Decoder, combined with Bounding Box prompt learning and **LCC (Largest Connected Component)** post-processing, the system achieves high-precision segmentation on the Kvasir-SEG dataset.

##  Quick Start

### 1. Installation

Ensure Python 3.8+ and PyTorch are installed. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
pip install segment-anything
pip install opencv-python scipy matplotlib tqdm tensorboard albumentations scikit-learn
```

### 2. Prepare Weights

This project uses SAM (ViT-B) as the base model. Download the weights and place them in the `Weights/` directory:

* [Download Link (sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth)](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth)

### 3. Prepare Dataset

Download the **Kvasir-SEG** dataset and ensure the directory structure matches below (or update `root_dir` in `Training.py`):

```text
MedicalSAM/
└── Kvasir-SEG/
    └── data/
        ├── images/
        └── masks/
```

### 4. Training

Run the main script to start training, validation, and testing:

```bash
python Training.py
```
